# DB Observability Notebooks
## About
Jupyter notebooks can be a powerful tool for quickly detecting database-related problems and gaining valuable insights into their root causes. By connecting to a database and leveraging data analysis libraries like pandas and matplotlib, data analysts can quickly explore and visualize the data, identify anomalies, and troubleshoot issues.

The DB Observability Notebook project is an open-source initiative that offers Jupyter Notebooks as a useful resource for resolving database-related problems. These Notebooks provide SQL commands and insights, which are later integrated into the [Metis](https://www.metisdata.io/) DB guardrail platform to create an automated investigation flow.
